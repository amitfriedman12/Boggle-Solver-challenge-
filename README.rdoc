* My solution to the 4x4 Boggle challenge described below:
* https://gist.github.com/scottburton11/a2d8afcee57d13232ed4

* My assumption is that words can not wrap around the edges.
* The users can select whether they allow words of length 2.

* ruby 2.1.0p0, rails 4.0.2

* Using the basic sqlite3, to set up the DB run:

$ rake db:migrate

* To run the test suite, run:

$ rspec/models/matrix_spec.rb

$ rspec/boggle_spec.rb
